A FaaS for Kubernetes

== Installation of the latest release

See link:https://projectriff.io/docs/getting-started-on-minikube/[Getting started on Minikube] or
link:https://projectriff.io/docs/getting-started-on-gke/[Getting started on GKE] for how to install riff with a Helm Chart,
and how to install the riff CLI.

== Developer installation

See link:Development-Helm-install.adoc[Installing the riff development version using Helm] to install the latest unreleased builds (git master branch) of riff.

NOTE: Since link:https://github.com/projectriff/riff/pull/578[PR #578] was merged, riff functions will be deployed only when linked to a topic with a link resource. To generate yaml files for links, you must run a development (snapshot) build of the CLI.

== [[manual]] Manual build

This is the best option if you want to modify the riff components.

=== Prerequisites

You need:

* A working Go environment
* A local 1.7+ Kubernetes cluster
* A docker daemon

To build images with docker in minikube, issue:

[source, bash]
----
eval $(minikube docker-env)
----

=== Get the main riff repo and install the CLI

[source, bash]
----
go get github.com/projectriff/riff
----
NOTE: This installs the CLI in the `bin` subdirectory of the first directory listed in `$GOPATH`, but doesn't
set the CLI version. To set the version, see the link:riff-cli/README.adoc[riff CLI README].

=== Build the riff core components

[source, bash]
----
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/projectriff/riff
make dockerize
----

=== Setup for development

If you want to quickly standup a development copy of riff:

NOTE: Starting with with Minikube v0.26.0 the default for Minikube is to use the kubeadm bootstrapper which enables RBAC. The older localkube bootstrapper is now deprecated. The following instructions assume that your cluster is running with RBAC enabled. It is still possible to install riff without RBAC roles by omitting the `rbac` target from the make command.

[source, bash]
----
make dev-setup
----

Which will:

* Create a `riff-system` namespace
* Deploy a non-replicated Kafka broker
* Install riff CRDs and system components
* Create a riff service account
* Install riff roles and rolebindings

=== To tear it all down

Once you're done playing with riff (see samples below), you can destroy everything created above by running:

[source, bash]
----
make teardown
----

To unset the environment variables used for building images with docker in minikube, issue:

[source, bash]
----
eval $(minikube docker-env -u)
----

== [[samples]]Try Some Samples

Sample functions are typically found in the corresponding invoker repositories.
See the link:https://github.com/projectriff?q=-invoker[projectriff invoker repositories] for example.

== Running the tests

To run all riff's unit and integration tests, ensure Kafka (with `auto.create.topics.enable=true`, which
is the default) and Zookeeper are running locally, then issue:

[source, bash]
----
KAFKA_BROKERS=localhost:9092 KAFKA_BROKER=localhost:9092 make test
----
