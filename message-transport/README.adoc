= Message Transport

== Purpose
The *message transport* is a https://projectriff.io/[Riff] component that enables the HTTP gateway to send messages
to function pods and, when appropriate, to receive replies.

It provides a message type and an abstract transport interface for sending and
receiving messages. It also provides an implementation of the transport interface
based on https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka].

== Development
